**Context** acts as a bridge that allows you to access and interact with the Android application environment. It provides a way to obtain resources, interact with app components, and access system services within the app. Using `Context`, you can also retrieve information about the device on which your app is running, such as screen size, time, and even details about other installed apps. 

#### **Context Types:**

1. **Component Context:**
    - Used by components such as **Activity** and **Service** to interact with their surrounding environment.
2. **Context Wrappers:**
    - **ContextWrapper** provides a way to modify or extend the functionality of another context (e.g., `ContextThemeWrapper` to change themes).
3. **Application Context:**
    - Associated with the **Application** and is used across the entire app lifecycle. It is best for scenarios where you need a global context that does not depend on a specific component (like an `Activity` or `Service`).

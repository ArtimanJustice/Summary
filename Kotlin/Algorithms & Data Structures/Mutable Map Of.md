in Kotlin, `mutableMapOf` uses a **hash-based implementation** by default. Specifically, the standard map returned by `mutableMapOf` is a `HashMap`, which is a hash table-based implementation of the `MutableMap` interface. 

A hash map offers an average time complexity of **O(1)** for these operations, making it a powerful tool in algorithms where performance is key. This is particularly useful when you need to maintain a dynamic collection of key-value pairs and want constant-time lookups or updates.

In many algorithms, you can use `mutableMapOf` to achieve optimal performance, especially when solving problems that require fast data retrieval or key-based associations, often reducing the time complexity to **O(n)**.
